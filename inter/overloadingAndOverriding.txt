1) What is method overloading in Java?
2) What is method overriding in Java?
3) What is method hiding in Java?
13) Can we override a method which throws run-time exception without throws clause?

        //add will throw Exception because List is readonly
        unmodifiableList.add("R.K. Narayan");
      
        //remove is not allowed in unmodifiable list
        unmodifiableList.remove(0);
