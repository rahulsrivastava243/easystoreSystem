Q=why wait called from synchronized?
Ans= to avoid racecondition between thread.

Q=whay wait and notify in Object?
Ans= b/c thread don't have any information related to other thread and lock are based on object not on thread.

Q= why @destroy , suspend(), and resume(), stop() is depricated?
Ans= @destroy :- it dosn't release the lock on shared resource. so dedloack can be create.

suspend() and resume():- after suspend if any thread tries to accure lock before calling resume then it will go for forever waiting.So deadlock.

 stop() :- It may left the shared object in curupted mode.For other thread. Although it releases the lock imidiatly.
 
 
 Q=Runnable vs thread?
 Ans= multiple inharitance is not supported in the case of java. (Thread class).
 On exteding thread we inherit all the properties of thread in the class. which makes it heavy wait then Runnable.
 we should try for best practices by coding for interface ,by using Runnable.
 Same runnable object can be executed by multiple thread but by extending thread we need to create new Thread always as Threads are started only once.
